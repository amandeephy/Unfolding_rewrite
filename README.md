# Unfolding_rewrite
Repository for checkpointing progress on the unfolding part of the top-quark-spin-correlations project maintained on gitlab.

Under `/src/` was a (brief) attempt to completely overhaul the C++ implementation using vectorized python code. Alas, it remained but a pipe-dream.

`Notebooks` have plenty of working examples which provide data checks, validation studies and recipes to compute statistical and systematic correlation and covariance matrices for the unfolded 1D and 2D variables.
